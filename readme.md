Rx
==
Reactive programming for Rust.

[![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]
[![Crates.io version][crate-img]][crate]

Rx is an attempt to bring the [Reactive Extensions][rx-sharp] for C# to Rust.
At the moment this is very much an experiment. I am not even sure if this is
at all feasible in Rust with the lifetimes all over the place.

Examples
